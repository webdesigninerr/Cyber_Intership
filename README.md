Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

Overview

This project implements a password-protected steganography tool that embeds encrypted messages into images using pixel-channel manipulation. The approach ensures controlled access and reliable extraction, enhancing traditional steganography techniques with robust security features.

Features

Password-Protected Steganography: Only authorized users with the correct password can decrypt the embedded message.

Dynamic Data Embedding: Supports variable-length messages and passwords with precise extraction.

Pixel-Channel Manipulation: Utilizes all three RGB channels for efficient data storage.

Lossless Image Format Support: Saves encrypted images in PNG format to prevent compression-based data loss.

User-Friendly GUI: Simplifies encryption and decryption through an intuitive graphical interface.

Error Handling and Validation: Ensures compatibility of image sizes and prevents runtime errors.

Customizable Input Image: Users can choose any image file for encryption.

Secure Delimiter System: Uses a unique delimiter (ASCII 255) to separate message and password during embedding and extraction.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language

OpenCV (cv2): Image processing and manipulation

Tkinter: GUI toolkit for user interface

NumPy: Array-based image data manipulation

File I/O: Handling PNG/JPEG image files for data embedding and retrieval
